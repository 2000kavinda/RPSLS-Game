                                              # Rock-Paper-Scissors -Spock-Lizard game

Brief overview of the coursework

For our Computer Graphics and Visualization course, we must create a gesture-controlled Rock-Paper-Scissors game to apply real-time image processing and visualization in a fun and innovative way. Our group chose to work on an interactive game by enhancing the original Rock-Paper-Scissors game into the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock version. Also, we deployed single‐player (against computer) and two‐players (multiplayer) modes in a dynamic and adjustable game play.
